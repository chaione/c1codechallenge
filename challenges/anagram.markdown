# Anagram

Write a program that, given a word and a list of possible anagrams, selects the correct one(s).

Given `"listen"` and `%w(enlists google inlets banana)` the program should return "inlets".

## Tests

Hint: Remove the `skip` message from the next test once the first test passes.

When all the tests are passing, post the result to a private [gist](http://gist.github.com).

Email the link to the created gist to [kelly@chaione.com](mailto://kelly@chaione.com).
