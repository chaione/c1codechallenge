# URL Shortener

Create a url shortening service like [Bit.ly](http://bit.ly) or [TinyURL](http://tinyurl.com)

The application should contain the following features:

* Take any valid http or https url and create a shortened url from it.
* Duplicate urls should return the same shortened url
* The shortened url should redirect to the original url

Write the service in ruby using whatever framework you prefer Rails, Sinatra, etc.
Deploy the application to [Heroku](http://heroku.com) and add heroku@chaione.com as a collaborator.


## Hints

* Don't use bit.ly or tinyurl, implement your own service.
* Tests are good.
* Make multiple commits. The goal here is to get an idea of your development process. That's difficult to assess when there's only one commit to look at.

## Going Further

Feel free to include additional features as you see fit.

Additional features could include _(but not limited to)_ :

* An API for accessing the services
* Custom aliases for urls
* Bookmarklets & widgets
* Reporting & Statistics
