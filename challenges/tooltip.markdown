# Tooltip #

Using [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/), [JSBin](http://jsbin.com/), or a related tool, design the Javascript, HTML, and CSS for a tooltip. The tooltip should have the following features:

- The tooltip can be applied to any div or span element
- On mouse over, display the tooltip
- Remove the tooltip when the mouse leaves the area
- It should be designed so that it is easily reusable

For this challenge, jQuery is the only external dependency allowed.

- How would you add an arrow in CSS to the tooltip indicating where it came from? An example:
