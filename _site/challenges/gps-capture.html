<p>You need to collect a <em>lot</em> of GPS data.</p>

<p>The data payload will have the following fields, and they must be valid:</p>

<ul>
<li>Latitude &amp; Longitude</li>

<li>Elevation</li>

<li>A timestamp</li>

<li>Client identification</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, the data payload may contain any other kind of data. It&#8217;s not clear right now what it might be, but you will need to collect and retain it for any future use of this data.</p>

<p>Data points can arrive in any order.</p>

<p>The client that produces this data might not be changeable in the future; once it is in the wild, you won&#8217;t have much control over it. New clients, however, might implement new versions of the data protocol.</p>

<p>In addition to capturing this data, it will need to be available to other consumers. These consumers might be business analysts or systems administrators within your organization, or third-parties.</p>

<p>Finally, dropping data is not acceptable. If you can&#8217;t immediately process a data payload, you&#8217;ll need a strategy for managing failures until they can be retried.</p>

<h2 id='challenge'>Challenge</h2>

<p>Describe in detail how you would design a system to accommodate this data.</p>

<ul>
<li>What is a broad overview of the system?</li>

<li>What are the key technologies in use? Why would you choose them?</li>

<li>How would you scale the system?</li>

<li>How would you handle legacy clients?</li>

<li>What would you do to store the data long-term?</li>

<li>How would you make data available to other consumers?</li>
</ul>
