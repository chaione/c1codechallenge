<p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boggle'>Boggle</a> is a word game played with alphabetic letter tiles arranged randomly on a grid. Players must identify words spelled by sequential adjacent letters in any direction (horizontally, vertically or diagonally), but may not use the same letter tile twice.</p>

<h2 id='challenge'>Challenge</h2>

<p>Write a program that solves a 5x5 randomly arranged Boggle grid.</p>

<p>Assume that your input file looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>ANRAI
GANCE
GLTIO
DSERI
SXOCL</code></pre>

<p>Each line has exactly 5 characters followed by a new line <code>\n</code> character. There are 5 lines. The output would be something like the following:</p>

<pre><code>NAG
RAN
TAN
TAG
RICE
SET
REST
...</code></pre>

<li>What are the key data structures in use here? What makes them more appropriate than alternatives?</li>

<li>Can your solution handle words that occur within other words? i.e. <code>&#39;catcher&#39; -&gt; [&#39;cat&#39;, &#39;catch&#39;, &#39;her&#39;]</code></li>
